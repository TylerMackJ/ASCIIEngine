# ASCIIEngine

# Discontinued

## Development is will now be continued on [ASCII Engine Rust](https://github.com/TylerMackJ/ascii-engine-rust)

ASCIIEngine is a 2D tri-based rendering system which displays through the use of a terminal/console window.

## Support

- Triangle
  - Individual vertex movement
  - Rotation around arbitrary points
  - Getting central coordinates
- Rectangle
  - Individual vertex movement
  - Rotation around arbitrary points
  - Getting central coordinates
  
## Upcoming

- N > 4 sided polygons
  - Used to generate circles of varied fidelity
- Z-Depth
- Shape texture options

## Future

- 3-D renderering
  1. Orthographic camera
  2. Projection based camera
